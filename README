These scripts provide a better interface to the team log statistics for
Yahoo fantasy baseball leagues -- specifically the Super Lounge Weights
League.


fetch_daily_team_totals.py <startteam> <numteams> <startdate>
	usage: fetch_daily_team_totals.py [-h] start_team num_teams start_date

	Fetch and parse daily team total stats. Play with the start_team and num_teams
	parameters to divide-and-conquer with a few parallel instances.

	positional arguments:
	  start_team  Team number of first team
	  num_teams   Number of teams to fetch
	  start_date  Start Date, as YYYY-MM-DD

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Suggested usage:

	#fetch all the data for all teams in a 12-team league since opening day
	./fetch_daily_team_totals 1 12 2014-03-26 > dailies.txt


The following operate on stat_tracker data, and have not been maintained:

fetch_data.sh pulls the datafiles to disk.  This requires Yahoo auth cookies;
	see the script itself for cookie requirements.

generate_playermap.py generates a mapping of player number to name

parse_st_data.py creates a team log (in CSV) from the stattracker_data file.
	As input, it relies on data/players.txt and data/stattracker_data.html

format_st_data_[h,p].py each take as input the output from parse_st_data.py
	and output hitting/pitching data in a human-readable format.


Suggested usage:
	# Get the data and generate the player map
	./fetch_data.sh
	./generate_playermap.py

	# Now output some reports
	# hitters, sorted by pts/PA
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_h.py   | sort -n -k 4 -r
	# pitchers, sorted by plus/minus
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_p.py | sort -n -k 4 -r
