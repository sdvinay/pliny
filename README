These scripts provide a better interface to the team log statistics for
Yahoo fantasy baseball leagues -- specifically the Super Lounge Weights
League, consuming the datafiles used by Yahoo's Stat Tracker.


fetch_data.sh pulls the datafiles to disk.  This requires Yahoo auth cookies;
	see the script itself for cookie requirements.

generate_playermap.py generates a mapping of player number to name

parse_st_data.py creates a team log (in CSV) from the stattracker_data file.
	As input, it relies on data/players.txt and data/stattracker_data.html

format_st_data_[h,p].py each take as input the output from parse_st_data.py
	and output hitting/pitching data in a human-readable format.


Suggested usage:
	# Get the data and generate the player map
	./fetch_data.sh
	./generate_playermap.py

	# Now output some reports
	# hitters, sorted by pts/PA
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_h.py   | sort -n -k 4 -r
	# pitchers, sorted by plus/minus
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_p.py | sort -n -k 4 -r
