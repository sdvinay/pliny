These scripts provide a better interface to the team log statistics for
Yahoo fantasy baseball leagues -- specifically the Super Lounge Weights
League.

As input, they consume the datafiles used by Yahoo's Stat Tracker, available
at URLs like:
http://baseball.fantasysports.yahoo.com/b1/stattracker_data?lid=18735&type=mlb
http://aud13.sports.sp2.yahoo.com/mlb/players.txt
(Swap in the appropriate league ID.  Note that this requires Yahoo
 authentication cookies.)

(It seems that at times lately the "teams" data is split into multiple lines.
The scripts expect it all on one line.  I open stattracker_data.html in an 
editor and manually join those lines back together.  Ugh.)


parse_st_data.py creates a team log (in CSV) from the stattracker_data file.
	As input, it relies on data/players.txt and data/stattracker_data.html

format_st_data_[h,p].py each take as input the output from parse_st_data.py
	and output hitting/pitching data in a human-readable format.


Suggested usage:
	# hitters, sorted by pts/PA
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_h.py   | sort -n -k 4 -r
	# pitchers, sorted by plus/minus
	./parse_st_data.py | ./format_st_data_p.py | sort -n -k 4 -r
